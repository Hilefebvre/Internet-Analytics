To avoid long cells of codes in the notebook, you can also embed long python functions and classes in a separate module. Donâ€™t forget to hand in your module if that is the case. In multiple exercises, you are required to come up with your own method to solve various problems. Be creative and clearly motivate and explain your methods. Creativity and clarity will be considered for grading.*"

Therefore every time a random friend is chosen it is more likely that this friend is young. Moreover at the beginning of the random walk there might be a bit of locality bias, since the first user (aged 19) is more likely to be connected to other young users even though this bias is quickly washed off by the depth first search nature of the algorithm."
